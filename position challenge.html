        <h2>LOGIN</h2>
        <p>You can improve the security of your Facebook account by getting an alert when someone tries logging in from a device or web browser that we don't recognise. These alerts will tell you which device tried logging in and where it's located.
            To get alerts about unrecognised logins:
            Go to your Security and login settings.
            Scroll down to Get alerts about unrecognised logins and click Edit.
            Choose where you want to receive your alerts, such as from your email account or with a Facebook notification from a recognised device.
            Click Save <br><br>
            After you start getting alerts about unrecognised logins:
            When you receive a login alert, you can tell us if you recognise the login activity by clicking or tapping This was me.
            If you don't recognise the login activity, click or tap This wasn't me and we'll help you reset your password and secure your account.
            You can save a device or browser to your list of trusted browsers or recognised devices. This way, you won't get alerts about the computer or mobile device that you usually use to log in to Facebook. Don't choose this option if you're using a public computer (such as one in a library or cafe).
            A list of recent devices that have logged in to your Facebook account can be found in your security and login settings.
